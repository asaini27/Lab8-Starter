**Graceful degradation** refers to the design strategy where a website or application is built to provide a basic level of functionality in older or less capable browsers, even if some advanced features are not supported. This ensures that all users can access essential content and functionality, regardless of their browser capabilities. 
**Service workers** are scripts that run in the background, separate from the web page, enabling features like offline access, background sync, and push notifications. They intercept network requests and can serve cached content, ensuring that users can still interact with the website even when they are offline or have a poor network connection.
